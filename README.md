# Threejs Shaders

This is a project I am using to learn how to code glsl shaders and the library three.js to display these shaders in a web browser. I am using Angular as a router to showcase the projects I have made. I also have another repository which consists of purely glsl shaders, which can be found [here](https://github.com/JoshRosner101/Shaders).

This project can be run by running the command "npm install" in the src folder to install the dependencies and "npm run start" in the src folder to start the server, which can be found at localhost:4200.
